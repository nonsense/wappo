The Kiowa tribe had fled the Zamanga forest after it was overrun by the monstrous Yum Chacs. Yum Chacs are believed to be demonic creatures back from the land of the dead. The Kiowas have since, settled safely in another forest far away from Zamanga. However in the flight for their lives, they left behind priceless treasures housed in many shrines of the large Kiowan stone temple located in the heart of the forest. 

Young Wappo, son of Chief Caddo has been chosen by his tribe to venture back to the temple in the heart of the Zamanga forest and retrieve the tribe's religious relics and treasures. To accomplish this, he has to brave the demonic Yum Chacs and other perilous obstacles that come in his way. 

Wappo, remains the only hope for his entire tribe, to regain their lost glory. Help Wappo outwit the heinous Yum Chacs, retrieve all the treasure and head back triumphantly to his tribe. 

Wappo has to navigate his way through the ruins of the abandoned temple. Wappo has two advantages over the Yum Chacs. First of all, they aren't as smart as he is and secondly as he knows the architecture of the temple better, enabling him to trap the Yum Chacs in pits and wall enclosures in the temple.

If you like puzzle games where you really need to use your brain, this one should be perfect. It's a classic type of game where you have to move Wappo from one place to a destination while avoiding the YumChacks. Each time you move one step, they will move twice and you have to make them stucked to be able to get safe to your destination without getting caught. I'm currently stucked on level 25, but hope to solve that level one day as well.
