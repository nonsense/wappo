# Wappo

Wappo - A game that I used to play on Siemens S55 mobile phone.

I coded this back in 2003-2004 as a side project while learning C++.

Features:

* A builder for new levels.
* Some of the levels that could be found on the Siemens S55 phone.
* Backtracking algorithm that solves each level.

You can install the game via the Wappo Installer.exe
